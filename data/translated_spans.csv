1673,,Does it make sense to increase the storage capacity and management of influential through new infrastructure?The answer is yes
1674,,"More than ever, it makes perfect sense"
1675,,"The more likely the extreme phenomena of precipitation (the longer and longer periods of drought, and the longer incidence of shorter periods with high precipitation falls), the more lack the structures that allow us to regularize the influential that wake up to the Tagus basin"

6454,,three years after the entry into operation of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAD)
6455,,three years after the entry into operation of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAD) there are many doubts that affect the legal regime that governs it
6456,,"it is not clear that, apparently, there is no legislative intention to discuss a reform of the TAD"
6457,,most of your problems are more than known
6458,,Arbitration is an excellent means of dispute resolution
6459,,there are many doubts that affect the legal regime that governs it
6460,,TAD has only two alternatives left
6461,,comprehensive reform
6462,,closure
6463,,we cannot ignore the issues surrounding the independence of the center and the independence and impartiality of the referees
6464,,center independence
6465,,independence and impartiality of arbitrators
6466,,"if the TAD does not recruit new arbitrators to join its list, those on it and who are successively appointed by the same parties call into question the duties of independence and impartiality"
6467,,those who are in it and who are successively appointed by the same parties call into question the duties of independence and impartiality
6468,,Setúbal has had a very strong identity for a long time.
6469,,sustainability that does not involve all these parts is not called sustainability
6470,,To govern is to choose a path and in Setúbal there has always been a lot of difficulty in choosing that path
6471,,in Setúbal there was always a lot of difficulty in choosing this path
6472,,we want to have a deep water port in an estuary with enormous sedimentary dynamics with jumping dolphins
6473,,"we want to have a deep water port in an estuary with enormous sedimentary dynamics with jumping dolphins, while promoting artisanal fishing and wonderful beaches"
6474,,we promote artisanal fishing and the wonderful beaches
6475,,the mouth of the river Sado and the estuary formed by it shape the way people lived and live in Setúbal
6476,,as a means of communication
6477,,as a food source
6478,,"It is not easy to assert itself as a great capital of the district, adjoining the capital of the country."
6479,,"provides us, free of charge, with many services that we call ecosystem services, and on which many economic activities in the region depend"
6480,,the biggest challenge we face in Sado and Arrábida
6481,,Economic activities that jeopardize the good functioning of ecosystems are in no way sustainable
6482,,The Serralves Foundation is a private foundation
6483,,I assume that those responsible can do whatever they want
6484,,"I assume that those responsible can do whatever they want, within the limits of the legislation that applies to them and to the extent that their institutional partners and funders accept what is done"
6485,,the specific characteristics of the author's work
6486,,specific characteristics of the author's work
6487,,reinforces the dynamics of gender discrimination
6488,,reinforces the dynamics of sexual discrimination (namely homophobia) and sometimes conveys indirect forms of racism
6489,,"an artistic institution, even if private, that aspires to international respectability and wants to assume a contemporary and cosmopolitan cultural vocation, must work with artistic directors and curators"
6490,,"The use of professionals with specialized knowledge allows the public to have adequate access to an overall view of an author's work in its various dimensions: an informed and articulated view, free from amputations or dismemberments dictated by spurious reasons."
6491,,"an informed and articulated vision, free from amputations or dismemberments dictated by spurious motives"
6492,,"That is why there are “artistic directors” and “curators” and that is why reputable institutions tend to respect their specific competences, as well as the powers and autonomy delegated to them."
6493,,"In fact, nothing forces this to happen."
6494,,"I imagine that those responsible for a private foundation like Serralves can dispense with or disallow the work of artistic directors or curators and decide according to their own political or economic goals, or their moral values ​​(or even according to their aesthetic whims). or sexual fetishes)"
6495,,even solely depending on the dictates of good management of their small or large parish interests
6496,,I cannot imagine the extent of the damage that the sight of some Mapplethorpe photographs can cause to a person under the age of 18
6497,,"I think I know, however, that it is very easy to find images on the internet capable of causing the same type of damage."
6498,,"perhaps it would be advisable to prohibit, in domains subject to the authority of the Serralves administration, the access of minors to the internet"
6499,,it is still not clear to me which censorship principle is applied
6500,,"Minors can't even enter or they just need to be accompanied by an adult, any adult"
6501,,"must be accompanied by family members and, in this case, what degree of kinship is required"
6502,,"a person aged 17 can be accompanied, for example, by a brother or a cousin who is already 18 years old"
6503,,an aunt or a grandfather may be considered valid for the purpose
6504,,the presence of duly identified parents will be essential
6505,,Is the presence of one of them enough or is the presence of both necessary?
6506,,greater comfort for potential visitors
6507,,it would be helpful to clarify these issues in future notices
6508,,A question that makes no sense to ask is that of the competence of the administration to make the decisions that it has taken.
6509,,(from what I believe I can deduce) is not legally obligated to respect the power or autonomy of artistic directors or curators
6510,,is not legally obligated to respect the power or autonomy of artistic directors or curators
6511,,the administration does not lack any artistic or cultural competence to make its decisions
6512,,"who can, send"
6513,,Based on this history
6514,,any type of prohibition or blocking of access to the vision and dissemination of Mapplethorpe's work configures an anti-liberal attitude that promotes the values ​​of censorship
6515,,"In the press, a “fee” is created on links to journalistic content when they include the title and a small preview"
6516,,a “fee” is created on links to journalistic content when they include the title and a small preview
6517,,The public consultation broke participation records
6518,,the text is not clear
6519,,proposals differ in detail
6520,,there are divergent interpretations
6521,,platforms such as Google News will also have to pay to list this content and take visitors to the respective media page
6522,,civil society initiatives and petitions on the subject have multiplied
6523,,even more is dangerous
6524,,it's dangerous
6525,,We know that the decrease in the circulation of professional journalistic content on social networks is followed by an increase in the circulation of fake news
6526,,this kind of filters are blind
6527,,incapable of distinguishing illicit uses from perfectly legal uses
6528,,Many are those who have spoken out against this reform
6529,,will adopt postures of tight censorship
6530,,numerous academics
6531,,human and digital rights organizations
6532,,It is regrettable that the path chosen to allegedly protect authors on the Internet involves violating the fundamental rights of citizens
6533,,The ends do not justify the means
6534,,nothing justifies censorship
6535,,free knowledge organizations like Wikimedia
6536,,free software communities
6537,,internet personalities
6538,,the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression
6539,,is followed with great interest by the citizens
6540,,"The Internet and the paradigm of generalized access to all kinds of works, almost always at no cost to the user (but also to the distributor), have established themselves in recent decades as an insurmountable reality."
6541,,"appropriation, by large technological multinationals, of the enormous cultural and economic value generated by the product of their work and investment"
6542,,an unsustainable reversal of the value chain
6543,,removed creators from the process of distributing the revenue they generated
6544,,leaving them in the role of spectators
6545,,powerless in the face of the enrichment of those who use their “products”
6546,,"real empires were installed, based on a position of total market dominance and grounded in a new ideological and social paradigm"
6547,,no system of wealth distribution should (or even can) subsist and prevail without remunerating the productive factor.
6548,,The digital revolution has made immediate and unlimited access to all kinds of “content” virtually possible.
6549,,"the EP opened the door to the creation of minimum conditions so that, in the “digital environment”, those who create and produce can receive their fair share of the millionaire profits generated by the digital demand for “content”"
6550,,this occurs through user-uploaded content platforms
6551,,Equating the recognition of the creator's right to prevent the unauthorized economic use of his own artistic expression with any form of censorship is a logical error.
6552,,"Equating the recognition of the creator's right to prevent the unauthorized economic use of his own artistic expression with any form of censorship is a logical error, as well as a demagogic argument."

6559,,depends exclusively on the private initiative of each taxpayer
6560,,"It is based on capitalization schemes associated with the Retirement Savings Plans (PPR), which are naturally privately managed."
6561,,This pillar (a collective private system) is based on an occupational scheme related to the company or sector of activity where the worker is inserted.
6562,,"It is, therefore, associated with a collective contributory logic, and may be mandatory or voluntary."
6563,,this option of the pension system is a complementary alternative – and I reinforce the complementary one – to the state pension scheme
6564,,I would like to highlight the fact that this pillar is complementary
6565,,this logic of “dangerous capitalists” and “large investment funds” that needs to be duly substantiated
6566,,so as not to give rise to an incipient political debate based on social and political conflicts about expectations related to the system
6567,,These kinds of statements demonstrate precisely that the debate on the future of pensions – including the policy options that Europe as a union wants to implement – ​​has been inconsequential.
6568,,which leads to reduced understanding of the system and its challenges by taxpayers
6569,,"The lack of plurality and insipience of this debate at the public, political and academic levels is not new."
6570,,there is no reason for workers not to “bet” on complementary options
6571,,Nor do they necessarily imply a complete replacement of redistributive systems by capitalization systems.
6572,,do not necessarily imply a complete replacement of redistributive systems by capitalization systems
6573,,"The Portuguese Social Security system itself provides a Public Capitalization Scheme – a “complementary individual and voluntary membership scheme, which allows additional contributions to be made throughout the active life of the member, which will be capitalized in an account in his/her name and converted into certificates of retirement"", the value being integrated into a common investment fund"
6574,,one thing is right

6593,,not everything is bad
6594,,"Not everything is bad, of course."
6595,,the atavistic entropy of public administration will certainly end up reducing the apparently ideal scenario to little more than dust.
6596,,"imposes the obligation to consign the generated revenues to institutions, as the MNAA has always claimed"
6597,,"Access to the modest income it generates (500 thousand euros), an essential basis for the ""sustainable management"" for which it has been fighting, would have saved the Museum"
6598,,"Such a benefit, added to the legal and fiscal autonomy (which has no burden), would have made it possible to increase resources and, step by step, allowed to shore up the human framework"
6599,,"In order to support and protect itself, the MNAA — whose difference in scale compared to other museums is prosaically perceptible — asked only for this NIF and access to its own revenues, essential for its ""sustained management"""
6600,,he was always told that those 500 thousand euros would generate a fatal imbalance in the public accounts
6601,,it is not only with fire that museums are destroyed; they also kill themselves administratively
6602,,I am not in the habit of responding to falsehoods and insinuations about myself.
6603,,we are not talking about bad details
6604,,of the central thesis of a campaign mounted in the media space to cast suspicion on my person and the management of CML

6611,,"About the land transaction, everything that FNS says is totally false"
6612,,"From what is public, not only was the land not sold for one euro, but it was not even sold to BES"
6613,,not only was the land not sold for one euro
6614,,was not even sold to BES
6615,,I insist
6616,,the CML does not have nor had to have information about this
6617,,"a company of the ECS group (in which the five main national banks participate and in which BES only had a minority stake of 10%) acquired the land with a debt of around 17 million euros, being today the promoter of the project"
6618,,"Since the time of President António Costa, these processes have been called up by the president and submitted by him to the plenary of the Chamber."
6619,,"These are administrative processes that, by their nature, are open to consultation with interested parties, the media and are subject to scrutiny by all oppositions."
6620,,A simple consultation of the chamber file shows the complete falsity of the statement and the insult of the same.
6621,,I will not let Nunes da Silva's offenses go unnoticed
6622,,I will take to the last consequences the defense of my good name
6623,,I will proceed with the appropriate legal action
6624,,One last question deserves comment.

6644,,it was obvious that the female body was his

6656,,the censorship effect does not end here

6659,,a curatorship within a curatorship
6660,,"If it is not curatorship and uncontrolled exorbitation of the latter's functions, it is a censorship instruction to the curatorial discourse"
6661,,Respect for the institutional order of functions and the values ​​of freedom of expression are elementary principles that have not been safeguarded by those who have this function.
6662,,"The articulation with the Ministry of Culture, which participates in the Serralves Foundation with 4 million euros annually, should have taken place and given rise to an inquiry into the events"
6663,,"If not everything is clear in this case, there is no doubt that an act of censorship has taken place."
6664,,not everything is clear in this case

6666,,"The question, to be clarified, of the integration in the programming of Joana Vasconcelos’ exhibition, I’m your mirror, coming from the Guggenheim in Bilbao, is yet another symptom of this problem."
6667,,there is no doubt that an act of censorship has taken place
6668,,"In this century, there has been an increasing presence of boards of directors in the life of museums or centers of contemporary art."
6669,,This attitude began with an emphasis on educational services
6670,,"This attitude began with an emphasis on educational services, not out of concern with the construction of mediation processes capable of enhancing the speculative domain over the exhibitions presented, an action more than desirable."

6675,,"a perspective adequate to the interests and possibilities of affirmation, exchange and recognition of national artistic practices in an international and current context is lost, reducing the national context to a position of mere consumer"
6676,,"More recently, controversies have been raised about the process of choosing artistic directors, generally appointed by the administrations"
6677,,many administrations are deeply committed to the processes I question and genuinely consider them to be the most appropriate for the success of their institutions
